						Turning a pick-your-own-adventure book into a video game is more difficult than I thought.
					</p>
					<p>
						Right now, my idea is to use a conveyor belt-like structure to carry events [With flavour text FLV, choice CHC and consequence CNQ] in order, based on a time variable t.
						<b>
						<br>
						<br>
						t = 0 : FLV [0]
						<br>
						t = 1 : FLV[1]
						<br>
						t = 2 : CHC[0]
						<br>
						t = 3 : CNQ[0]
						<br>
						t = 4 : FLV[2]
						</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						And storing each of these FLV/CHC/CNQ elements in their own arrays, with the CHC/CNQ arrays paired to each other, where CNQ[i] is the consequence resulting from choice CHC[i].
						<br>
						It's probably an overcomplicated way of trying to make everything modular but I can't think of anything else...

						This is the first post. Welcome to the blog! I'm going to call it Anthracit3, because I love that word.
<br><br>
						<b>ANTHRACITE: </b>
						The best type of coal. High in carbon, low in impurities. It is metallic, and a melancholy grey in colour.  <br> <br><i>Her eyes were an anthracite grey, the colour of a static tempest.</i>
